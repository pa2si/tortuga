  description:
    'After studying Romance philology, finishing a certificate in journalism, working in a supermarket, a café, a bakery, a literar agency, a hostel, working with disabled children and seniors, I first finished the oral storytelling course with Erzählkunst e.V. (the association of the art of storytelling), and later "Storytelling in Arts and Education" at the University of Arts in Berlin. Since 2017 I have been telling stories in schools, theaters, libraries, family centers, museums, festivals, cafés and parks, wherever a good story is needed.',
